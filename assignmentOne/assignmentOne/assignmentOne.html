    <h1>Eric Hooten</h1>
    <h2>Junior Computer Science Major</h2>
    <p1>Hello! My name is Eric and I am a CompSci major going into my junior year. I am from Kansas City and enjoy cooking, video games, working out, and doing anything outside. I chose computer science because I have always been pretty good with computers and they make decent money.</p1>
