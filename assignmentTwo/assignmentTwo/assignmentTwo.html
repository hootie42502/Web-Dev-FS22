        Destiny 2 is an action RPG which features two core activities, Player vs Player, and Player vs Enemy. The PvP mode offers a competitive experience and a sandbox of different features to play with. The PvE side features mulitplayer raids and missions. Both of these sides are seperate yet connected in that you play the smae character, and what you earn in one area can be used in the other.
